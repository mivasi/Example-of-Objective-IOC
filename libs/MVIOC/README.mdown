Objective IOC

Inversion Of Control for objective-c.

How to add library into yout project
====================================

Objective IOC is compiled as a static library. So you can add it to your
project as "dependent project".

1. Clone project somewhere with git://github.com/mivasi/Objective-IOC.git

2. Locate the "IOC.xcodeproj" file under "`src/`". Drag IOC.xcodeproj and
   drop it onto the root of your Xcode project's "Groups and Files"  sidebar.  A dialog will
   appear -- make sure "Copy items" is unchecked and "Reference Type" is "Relative to Project"
   before clicking "Add".

3. Now you need to link the MVIOC static libraries to your project.  Select IOC.xcodeproj that you just added to the sidebar.
   Under the "Details" table, you will see libIOC.a and UnitTests.octest. Check the checkbox on the far right for each of
   the libIOC.a file (not the UnitTests). This will link each part of the MVIOC framework to your app.

4. Now you need to add MVIOC as a dependency of your project, so Xcode compiles it whenever
   you compile your project.  Expand the "Targets" section of the sidebar and double-click your
   application's target.  Under the "General" tab you will see a "Direct Dependencies" section. 
   Click the "+" button, select "IOC" and click "Add Target". You do *not* need to add the `UnitTests` target for each lib.

5. Finally, we need to tell your project where to find the MVIOC headers.  Open your
   "Project Settings" and go to the "Build" tab. Look for "Header Search Paths" and double-click
   it.  Add the relative path from your project's directory to the "src/Classes/" directory.

6. While you are in Project Settings, go to "Other Linker Flags" under the "Linker" section, and
   add "-ObjC" and "-all_load" to the list of flags.

7. You're ready to go.  Just #import "MVIOC/MVIOC.h" anywhere you want to use MVIOC classes
   in your project.
